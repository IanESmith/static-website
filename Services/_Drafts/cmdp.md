### What is blocking us
Always best call out the bad news first, so....

 - need clarity on the project managment process: is this going to be agile or waterfall?

- added a secturity resource (Reecca White at 50%) and a civil servant developer (daniel Martin) to the team
- test strategy
-  finalise the scope
- start reporting on progress and estimated due date
- add the reporting metrics to this page

### About to do

- security folks
-  finalise the scope
