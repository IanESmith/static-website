### What is blocking us
Always best call out the bad news first, so....
<sapce><space>
- The scope for the MVP is still not finalised, meaning we cant start tracking and reporting progress. However, the good news is that with a Product Manager in place, this should be resolved in the next few days

### Just done

- been assessed by the Service Standards team: no showstoppers but it did give us some areas to improve
- started joining up our plan with the Advanced Border Controls team
- agreed Alistair McKay as the Product Manager
- started work on the Security Epic

### About to do

- finalise the scope
- start reporting on progress and estimated due date

### Things to be aware off

- we'll need to grow the team (including user researchers, developers, security folk)
- we're going to start planning for after MVP and agreeing the next users
