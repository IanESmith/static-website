## Common Data Matching Platform
Status as at 25 July 2017

### What is blocking us
Always best call out the bad news first, so....

 - The scope for the MVP is still not finalised, meaning we cant start tracking and reporting progress. However, the good news is that with a Product Manager in place, this should be resolved in the next few days

### Just done

 - been assessed by the Digital Service Standard team: no showstoppers but it did give us some areas to improve
 - started joining up our plan with the Advanced Border Controls team
 - agreed Alistair McKay as the Product Manager
 - started work on the Security Epic

### About to do

 - finalise the scope
 - start reporting on progress and estimated due date
 - add the reporting metrics to this page

### Things to be aware off

 - we'll need to grow the team (including user researchers, developers, security folk)
 - we're going to start planning for after MVP and agreeing the next users
