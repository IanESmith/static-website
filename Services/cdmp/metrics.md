## Common Data Matching Platform
Status as at 8th Aug 201


### What is blocking us


### Just done

- agree the scope of the security assurance for MVP and beyond
- start reporting on progress and estimated due date
- add the reporting metrics to this page
- finalise the live support model

- confirmed the scope for the MVP (to provide the Advance Border Control project with a live service that stores data)
- begun planning live support discussions with 
- added a secturity resource (Rebecca White at 50%) and a civil servant developer (Daniel Martin) to the team
- test strategy
- started reporting on progress and estimated due date
- add the reporting metrics to this page

### About to do
- agree the scope of the security assurance for MVP and beyond
- start reporting on progress and estimated due date
- add the reporting metrics to this page
- finalise the live support model
- started reporting on estimated due date

### Things to be aware off

 - we'll need to grow the team (including user researchers and developers)
 - need clarity on the project managment process: is this going to be agile or waterfall?
-  we've lost our tech lead. 

### Metrics
The next goal is Release Candidate 1, a live accredited and supported platform for Advance Border Controls.
