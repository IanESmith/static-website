## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 14 November 2017
Working with our Advanced Border Control and HMPO colleagues to provide a platform for their data by 2018 and then start to onboard more tenants.

### What is blocking us
All good at present. We have recently added a product manager and developer to the team.

### Just done
- supported our ABC colleagues who have successfully connected to the CDP (on development and test environments)
- completing all the Release 1 work with the focus on completing the automation
- refined the [metrics](Metrics.html) around planning and predictablity
- started our first HMPO epic, to enable them to start building and testing migration scripts
- published the new tracking and predictability metrics covering all CDP releases

### About to do/doing
- final session with HMPO to agree the detailed plan and roadmap
- start building the services for Release 2
- create the CDP account on ServiceNow to prepare for Live Support (this is taking a while but isnt a problem)
- migrate to the Collaboration Jira instance so we can provide real time reporting via Confluence
- add risks/issues/blockers to our reporting metrics

### Things to be aware off
With two new starters, there has been some frustrations about how long it has taken to get them up and running. Without a HO email address theres no access to our core developer tools and systems. The team health check shows a bit of a dip, possibly caused by this frustration.
