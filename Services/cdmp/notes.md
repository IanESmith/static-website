## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 14 November 2017
Working with our Advanced Border Control and HMPO colleagues to provide a secure platform for their data and then start to onboard more tenants.

### What is blocking us
We're hanging on. We have recently added a product manager and developer to the team.

### Just done
- supported our ABC colleagues to successfully connect to the CDP on development and test environments
- refined the [metrics](metrics.html) around planning and predictablity (rechecking sizes & progress)
- started our first HMPO epic (to enable them to start building and testing migration scripts)
- met with Hortonworks team to ensure they are aware of our plans and able to support
- published our [sprint goals](https://collaboration.homeoffice.gov.uk/display/CDP/E.+Sprint+Goals)

### About to do/doing
- final session with HMPO to agree the detailed plan and roadmap
- completing all the Release 1 work (mainly the remaining automation)
- start building the services for Release 2
- create the CDP account on ServiceNow to prepare for Live Support (this is taking a while but isnt a problem)
- migrate to the Collaboration Jira instance so we can provide real time reporting via Confluence
- review/action the risks/issues/blockers and then add to our reporting metrics

### Things to be aware off
Christmas key dates:
- last show and tell - Nov 21
- last retrospective - 12 Dec
- full team available until 15 Dec, then skeleton team until 22nd of Dec.
- all back for 2018 on Jan 2

Our sprint notes are meant to be fairly light, but we're aware of the need for effective reporting. So, once we're on the same Jira and Confluence, we'll build a full set of reports and dashboards covering both programme and project (meaning you can easily glean what you need). 

Our show and tells take place the last week of every month and are a great way to find out what we're doing and to ask any questions you may have.
