## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 14 November 2017
Working with our Advanced Border Control and HMPO colleagues to provide a secure platform for their data and then start to onboard more tenants.

### What is blocking us
We're hanging on. We have recently added a product manager and developer to the team.

### Just done
- supported our ABC colleagues to successfully connect to the CDP on development and test environments
- refined the [metrics](metrics.html) around planning and predictablity (rechecking sizes & progress)
- started our first HMPO epic (to enable them to start building and testing migration scripts)
- met with Hortonworks team to ensure they are aware of our plans and able to support

### About to do/doing
- final session with HMPO to agree the detailed plan and roadmap
- completing all the Release 1 work (mainly the remaining automation)
- start building the services for Release 2
- create the CDP account on ServiceNow to prepare for Live Support (this is taking a while but isnt a problem)
- migrate to the Collaboration Jira instance so we can provide real time reporting via Confluence
- review/action the risks/issues/blockers and then add to our reporting metrics

### Things to be aware off
With two new starters, there has been some frustratiing blockers. For example, without a HO email address theres no access to our core developer tools and systems meaning its hard to get up and running quickly. The team health check shows a bit of a dip, possibly caused by this frustration. Our retrospective should help us uncover the reasons and we can look for ways to help.
