## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 28 Feb 2018
Working with our Advanced Border Control and HMPO colleagues to provide a secure platform for their data and then start to onboard more tenants.

## Release 1.1

### What is blocking us
- contrary to what theyd said, CSOC cant provide us with protective monitoring by March and wont onboard us until Dec 2018. Without this we get no ATO and cant go live. We've escalated.
- the team have not been able to come off their current tasks to support the OAT team so that work is taking longer than expected

### Just done
- ITHC (Penetration testing) and fixes and deployed these to all environments
- added and sized a new epic to support the ABC testing using live data on preprod

### About to do/doing
- seeking 'Authority to Operate' and Accreditation
- completing all the operational preparation for going live at the end of March

## Release 2

### Just done
- installed the Hardware Security Modules (ie racked and cabled) into HODC1 and 2
- clarified the user needs for ABC Release 2- there is a new epic added to support the ABC testing using live data on preprod

### About to do/doing
- completing the Hardware Security Modules commissioning
- setting up a POISE laptop to use as a 'break glass' solution in case of live incidents
- recruiting an analyst (to look for benefits, savings opportunities for the CDP) and a tech 'ambassador' (someone who can share what we are doing across the HO and work with other teams to leverage solutions benefitting both CDP and their own products
- complete the programme health check questionairre and invite ABC, HMPO and CDP folk to submit their responses
- publish and share the roadmap for 2018 showing all our deliverables for ABC, HMPO and CDP
- publish the test strategy

### Things to be aware off
 - CDP and ABC due to go live by the end of March
 - We havnt had the time to create a suite of reports to provide automatic programme and project status (ie live from jira) including all milestones, risks/issues and dependencies but we'll get there
