## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary at 6 September  2017
Working with our Advanced Border Control colleagues to provide a platform for their data.
We are also starting to plan bringing our HMPO colleagues onto the Commmon Data Platform.

### What is blocking us
Our main challenge is around people. We no longer have a technical lead, the team is very small, and the challenges around folk away on holiday or affected by the Waterloo disruption will reduce our effectiveness. We're tracking progress and am able to see the team velocity (and its impact on due dates). Its possible we may lose the security team also.

### Just done
- continued the threat and risk security assessment which is now being reviewed
- contined work on the infrastructure and services epics
- split out all the CDP  security work (needed for the whole platform) from the ABC specific security work (needed for Release Candidate 1) so that we can deliver/track what our ABC colleagues need whilst still progressing for the longer term

### About to do/doing
- focus the team on completing all the security work required for the entire CDP platform (not just ABC)
- add agreed actions from the threat and risk security assessment to the backlog
- finalise the (light touch) live support model using Service Now
- show and tell our work around security and accreditation
- attend the workshop (14 Sep) to build a roadmap for onboarding HMPO
- add the team health data to the [metrics](metrics.html)

### Things to be aware off
Adding all the CDP security work as a new epic means our delivery for ABC looks a bit challenging. In fact, its not, we're all on track for the October release and if we need to we can delay the remainder of the CDP security work with no impact. So we getting ahead of the delivery, not behind. If that makes sense.
