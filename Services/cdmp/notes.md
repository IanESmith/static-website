## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 10 Apr 2018
We have provided a secure platform for Advanced Border Control data. Next we're going to deliver an ingestion pipeline that transforms data to the POLE standard, create some query and matching functionality, allow editing of records and add more security controls that will allow HMPO to be onboarded.

### What is blocking us
- our backlog and roadmap have been a little obtuse and hard to read so we're simplifing this, and ensuring it maps to our tenants needs, making it easier for them to see whats done, in progress or coming up next
- need to ensure that TDCS have their resources (on both CDP and ABC) working to an agreed and coherent test approach. So, we're asking them to ensure this is visible, understood and agreed by CDP and its tenants

## July Release

### Just done
- created method of connecting any new environments to the Hardware Security Modules so these are now fully installed
- completed the work so CSOC can provide protective monitoring
- change the title of releases from numbers (ie "Release 1,2,3") to months (ie "June Release, October Release")
- first BA analysis and roadmap tweaks
- had the first technical show and tell for the developer community

### About to do/doing
- continuing work on the July Release functionality
- publish and share the roadmap for 2018 showing all our deliverables for ABC, HMPO and CDP
- have TDSC complete and publish their test strategy (covering functional, security, performance, infrastructure) and what the split/share /overlap between CDP and its tenants is


### Things to be aware off
   - metrics for the next release will be available once the roadmap completed
