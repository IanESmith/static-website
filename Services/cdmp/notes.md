## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 18 October  2017
Working with our Advanced Border Control and HMPO colleagues to provide a platform for their data by 2018 and then start to onaboard more tenants.

### What is blocking us
Our main challenge is remains around having a very small technical team. We're working to resolve this and tracking progress so able to see the velocity (and any impact on due dates). 

### Just done
- opened up access to the teams Confluence Space making it easier for you to find things like [Team Details](https://collaboration.homeoffice.gov.uk/display/CDP/A.+Team)
- interviewed three devops candidates
- fed all the work from the security risk assessment into our roadmap and backlog
- had a test and development lead review  our developement  & test strategy and made some recommendations
- agreed scope for pen testing

### About to do/doing
- now that we have completed Release Candidate 1A, I'll rebuild the metrics and burnup to show progress towards having a live platform (ie Release Candidate 1)
- ensure we are logging to meet the ABC and Security needs
- create the CDP account on ServiceNow
- start connecting (and testing) ABC to the CDP (if they are ready)
- finalise the detailed roadmap to onboard HMPO
- update the roadmap and share with with you all
- create new burnup to cover the remaining work for the ABC release candidate 1

### Things to be aware off
- We're going to chnage our terminology ie start reporting progress to 'CDP Releases' (but call out the added benefits, new features and which tenants (ie ABC, HMPO etc) these are of value to). This will also be on our shared roadmap which you'll be able to access by next week
- Though the due date for Release Candidate 1 is March 2018, we're planning on completing most of our work by the end of 2017 (to allow pen testing to take place in Jan 2018)

Im building a new burnup and metric page to now show progress towards Release Candidate 1. This should available in a couple of days....
