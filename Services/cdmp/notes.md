## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 7 Feb 2018
Working with our Advanced Border Control and HMPO colleagues to provide a secure platform for their data and then start to onboard more tenants.

### What is blocking us
- nothing at this stage

### Just done
- finalised the scope for Release 2
- delivered the preprod environment for ABC and Operational Assurance/ Penetration testing
- added two new epics around Operational Assurance Testing (hence the jump in scope): the good news is we've also added two testers to the team to help complete this testing
- renamed our slack channel for onboarding tenants from 'cdp_onboarding_abc' to 'cdp_onboarding' in preparation for bringing our HMPO colleages into the mix

### About to do/doing
- installing the Hardware Security Modules (ie racked. cabled and commissioned) into HODC1 and 2
- Penetration and Operational Assurance Testing
- completing all the operational preparation for going live at the end of March
- create a suite of reports to provide automatic programme and project status (ie live from jira) including all milestones, risks/issues and dependencies
- finalsing and documenting the test strategy

### Things to be aware off
 - Our high level roadmap is currently being revamped to add in programme milestones as well as project as well as being moved to Confluence to make it a bit more readable. Should be with available in a few days
 
 - This is your first sprint notes for 2018, missed one due to holidays....
