## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 31 October 2017
Working with our Advanced Border Control and HMPO colleagues to provide a platform for their data by 2018 and then start to onboard more tenants.

### What is blocking us
Although our main challenge is around having a very small team, we are planning on bringing on three new team members in the next few weeks.
We're also still waiting for our ABC colleages to be ready to connect to CDP and start testing. This was due mid October.

### Just done
- finalised the detailed plan and roadmap to onboard HMPO
- updated the [Roadmap](https://collaboration.homeoffice.gov.uk/display/CDP/A.+Roadmap) in Confluence (showing high level milestones) and detailed plan in [Jira](https://jira.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=13201) (showing all the detail). Note that  access to Jira is restricted
- ensured our plans for logging meet the ABC and security accreditation needs
- continued all the work to have the platform ready to be accredited and live by Feb 2018

### About to do/doing
- working with the ABC Product Manager to confirm the scope of Release 2
- support our ABC colleages when they are ready to connect to the CDP and begin testing
- create the CDP account on ServiceNow to prepare for Live Support
- publish the new tracking and predictability metrics covering all CDP releases

### Things to be aware off
Dont forget the [CDP Team details](https://collaboration.homeoffice.gov.uk/display/CDP/A.+Team) are available if you need to find someone or ask a question.
