## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary at 6 September  2017
Working with our Advanced Border Control colleagues to provide a platform for their data.
We are also starting to plan bringing our HMPO colleagues onto the Commmon Data Platform.

### What is blocking us
Our main challenge is around people. We no longer have a technical lead, the team is very small, and the challenges around folk away on holiday or affected by the Waterloo disruption will reduce our effectiveness. We're tracking progress and am able to see the team velocity (and its impact on due dates). Its possible we may lose the security team also.

### Just done
- started work on the threat and risk security assessment
- continuing work on the infrastructure and services epics

### About to do/doing
- add agreed actions from the threat and risk security assessment to the backlog
- finalise the (light touch) live support model using Service Now
- show and tell our work around security accreditation
- attend the workshop (14 Sep) to build a roadmap for onboarding HMPO
- add the team health data to the [metrics](metrics.html)

### Things to be aware off
THese sprint notes are a bit scant due to the Delivery Manager just returning from holiday and having to catch up.
