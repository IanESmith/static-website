## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 10 Apr 2018
We have provided a secure platform for Advanced Border Control data. Now we're going to deliver an ingestion pipeline that transforms data to the POLE standard, create some query and matching functionality, allow editing of records and add more security controls that will allow HMPO to be onboarded.

### What is blocking us
- our backlog and roadmap are a little obtuse and hard to read so we're going to simplify this, and ensure it maps to our tenants needs, making it easier for them to see whats done, in progress or coming up next
- need to ensure that TDCS have their resources (on both CDP and ABC) working to an agreed and coherent test approach. So, we're asking them to ensure this is visible, understood and agreed by both teams in the coming days

## July Release

### Just done
- continued working on the ingestion pipeline, query and CRUD functionality
- procured and configured 2 laptops to use as a 'break glass' solution in case of live incidents
- scheduled technical show and tells every two weeks so the developer community can be kept up to date what what we're building
- recruited an analyst (to look for benefits, savings opportunities for the CDP) and a tech 'ambassador' (someone who can share what we are doing across the HO and work with other teams to leverage solutions benefitting both CDP and their own products

### About to do/doing
- have CSOC complete their work by April 9 and then will close the Protective Monitoring epic
- create method of connecting any new environments to the Hardware Security Modules
- change the title of releases from numbers (ie "Release 1,2,3") to months (ie "June Release, October Release")
- completing the Hardware Security Modules commissioning
- complete the programme health check questionairre and invite ABC, HMPO and CDP folk to submit their responses
- publish and share the roadmap for 2018 showing all our deliverables for ABC, HMPO and CDP
- have TDSC complete and publish their test strategy (covering functional, security, performance, infrastructure) and what the split/share /overlap between CDP and its tenants is
- build the metrics for the July release

### Things to be aware off
- THere is a very small amount of work still remaining around Live Support and Protective Monitoring, hence the metrics page still showing 1% remaining 
  - I need the Product and PMO team to work with me to finish a suite of reports to provide automatic programme and project status (ie live from jira) including all milestones, risks/issues and dependencies but we'll get there. Done the blockers and Live Incidents reports tho!
