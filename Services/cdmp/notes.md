## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 6 December 2017
Working with our Advanced Border Control and HMPO colleagues to provide a secure platform for their data and then start to onboard more tenants.

### What is blocking us
All good for now. Two procurements are required and can be slow but we kicked them off early so hopefully should be ready in time.

### Just done
- received commercial and financial approval for the Request to Purchase four [hardware security modules](https://hsm.utimaco.com/products/general-purpose-hsm/securityserver-se-gen2/)
- completed the Release 1 logging and montitoring functionality
- created the CDP account on ServiceNow to prepare for Live Support
- started building the services for Release 2
- migrated to the Collaboration Jira instance so we can provide better/real time reporting via [Confluence](https://collaboration.homeoffice.gov.uk/display/CDP/Reporting+Dashboard)

### About to do/doing
- support ABC testing
- more sessions with HMPO delivery team to to progress the plan and roadmap
- complete all the Release 1 work (mainly the remaining automation)
- add someone to the team to continue to progress the test coverage
- book the ITHC (Pen testing) if the procurement process has completed

### Things to be aware off
Christmas key dates:
- last show and tell - Nov 21
- last retrospective - 12 Dec
- full team available until 15 Dec, then skeleton team until 22nd of Dec.
- all back for 2018 on Jan 2

Note that we have two epics we were hoping to complete this year and are a bit behing (our onboarding checklist and HMPO Pole standard) but they are not going to impact Release 1 if a little late.
