## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 28 November 2017
Working with our Advanced Border Control and HMPO colleagues to provide a secure platform for their data and then start to onboard more tenants.

### What is blocking us
All good for now.

### Just done
- recieved commercial and financial approval for the Request to Purchase four [hardware security modules](https://hsm.utimaco.com/products/general-purpose-hsm/securityserver-se-gen2/)

- completing the logging and montitoring functionality
- created the CDP account on ServiceNow to prepare for Live Support
- started building the services for Release 2
- migrated to the Collaboration Jira instance so we can provide real time reporting via Confluence

### About to do/doing

- support ABC testing
- session with HMPO delivery team to to progress the plan and roadmap
- complet all the Release 1 work (mainly the remaining automation)

### Things to be aware off
Christmas key dates:
- last show and tell - Nov 21
- last retrospective - 12 Dec
- full team available until 15 Dec, then skeleton team until 22nd of Dec.
- all back for 2018 on Jan 2

Our sprint notes are meant to be fairly light, but we're aware of the need for effective reporting. So, once we're on the same Jira and Confluence, we'll build a full set of reports and dashboards covering both programme and project (meaning you can easily glean what you need). 

Our show and tells take place the last week of every month and are a great way to find out what we're doing and to ask any questions you may have.
