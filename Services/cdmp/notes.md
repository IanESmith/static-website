## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 10 Apr 2018
We have provided a secure platform for Advanced Border Control data. Now we're going to deliver an ingestion pipeline that transforms data to the POLE standard, create some query and matching functionality, allow editing of records and add more security controls that will allow HMPO to be onboarded.

### What is blocking us
- our backlog and roadmap are a little obtuse and hard to read so we're simplifing this, and ensuring it maps to our tenants needs, making it easier for them to see whats done, in progress or coming up next
- need to ensure that TDCS have their resources (on both CDP and ABC) working to an agreed and coherent test approach. So, we're asking them to ensure this is visible, understood and agreed by both teams in the coming days

## July Release

### Just done
- completed the work so CSOC can provide protective monitoring
- change the title of releases from numbers (ie "Release 1,2,3") to months (ie "June Release, October Release")
- intial BA analysis and roadmap tweaks

### About to do/doing
- create method of connecting any new environments to the Hardware Security Modules
- complete the programme health check questionairre and invite ABC, HMPO and CDP folk to submit their responses
- publish and share the roadmap for 2018 showing all our deliverables for ABC, HMPO and CDP
- have TDSC complete and publish their test strategy (covering functional, security, performance, infrastructure) and what the split/share /overlap between CDP and its tenants is
- build the metrics for the next releas

### Things to be aware off
  - We need the Product and PMO team to finish a suite of reports to provide automatic programme and project status (ie live from jira) including all milestones, risks/issues and dependencies. Done the blockers and Live Incidents reports tho (see links below)
