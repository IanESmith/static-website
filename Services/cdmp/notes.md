## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 3 October  2017
Working with our Advanced Border Control and HMPO colleagues to provide a platform for their data.

### What is blocking us
Our main challenge is remains around only having a very small technical team. We're working to resolve this and tracking progress so able to see the velocity (and any impact on due dates). 

### Just done
- completed pretty well all of the work for Release Candidate 1A (except Monitoring for which ABC have not yet provided requirements and Logging (which may needed sooner than expected))
- completed much of the security work required for the entire CDP platform (not just ABC)
- 'show and tell' our work around security and accreditation
- fed all the work from the security risk assessment into our roadmap and backlog

### About to do/doing
- ensure we are logging to meet the ABC needs
- create the CDP account on ServiceNow
- start connecting (and testing) ABC to the CDP
- finalise the detailed roadmap to onboard HMPO
- agree scope for pen testing
- connect ABC (Dev and Test) to CDP
- review of test strategy and reccomnedations made
- ensure all HO folk can see our [Confluence Space](https://collaboration.homeoffice.gov.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=21019374)
- interviewed three devops candidates
- create new burnup to cover the remaining work for the ABC release candidate 1

### Things to be aware off
- Most of the work the team will be doing from this point on (once ABC are connecting to our dev and test environments) will be around preparing the platform for accreditation.
-Though the due date for Release Candidate 1 is March 2018, we're planning on completing most of our work by the end of 2017 (to allow pen testing to take place in Jan 2018)
