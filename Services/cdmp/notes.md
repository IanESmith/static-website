## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 31 January 2018
Working with our Advanced Border Control and HMPO colleagues to provide a secure platform for their data and then start to onboard more tenants.

### What is blocking us
- we need a decision around the release 2 architecture including image storage, ingestion, graph database.

### Just done
- delivered the preprod environment for ABC, Operational and Penetration testing
- finalised plan to installed Hardware Security Modules (ie racked. cabled and commissioned) into HODC1 and 2
- finalised scope for Release 1.1, sized anything new, created the metrics and burnup chart
- added two new epics around Operational Assurance Testing (hence the jump in scope): the good news is we've also added two testers to the team so this should not impact due dates
- welcomed a new developer to the team to replace one who leaves end of jan

### About to do/doing
- commission the Hardware Security Modules
- start Penetration testing
- finalise the scope for Release 2
- create a suite of reports to provide automatic programme and project status (ie live from jira) including all milestones, risks/issues and dependencies

### Things to be aware off
 - Our high level roadmap is currently being revamped to add in programme milestones as well as project as well as being moved to Confluence to make it a bit more readable. Should be with available in a few days
