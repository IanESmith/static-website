## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 24 Apr 2018
We have provided a secure platform for Advanced Border Control data. Next we're going to deliver an ingestion pipeline that transforms data to the POLE standard, create some query and matching functionality, allow editing of records and add more security controls that will allow HMPO to be onboarded.

### What is blocking us
- need to ensure that TDCS have their resources (on both CDP and ABC) working to an agreed and coherent test approach. So, we're asking them to ensure this is visible, understood and agreed by CDP and its tenants

## July Release

### Just done
- added a new team member with the role of 'technical ambassador' who will be working alongside our new BA to help ensure the right solutions for our current and future partners
- simplified the roadmap ensuring it maps to our tenants needs, making it easier for them to see whats done, in progress or coming up next - now reviewing it and then finalising
- continuing work on the July Release functionality
- added a few new [reporting dashboards](https://collaboration.homeoffice.gov.uk/display/CDP/Reporting+Dashboards+-+being+built) - note that tho some of these are still under construction, there is quite a lot of useful detail so worth taking a look

### About to do/doing
- ensure the KPIs fully understood and visible
- complete the spike on what is the best solution for querying the data
- have TDCS complete and publish their test strategy (covering functional, security, performance, infrastructure) and what the split/share/overlap between CDP and its partners is
- publish and share the roadmap for 2018 showing all our deliverables for ABC, HMPO and CDP along with confidence levels and status

### Things to be aware off
   - metrics for the next release will be available once the roadmap completed
