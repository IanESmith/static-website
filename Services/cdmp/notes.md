## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 21 Feb 2018
Working with our Advanced Border Control and HMPO colleagues to provide a secure platform for their data and then start to onboard more tenants.

### What is blocking us
- still seems some ambiguity around what our ABC colleages need from us for 2018 so working closely with them to confirm.

### Just done
- installed the Hardware Security Modules (ie racked and cabled) into HODC1 and 2
- Penetration and Operational Assurance Testing
- created a suite of reports to provide automatic programme and project status (ie live from jira) including all milestones, risks/issues and dependencies
- finalised the test strategy

### About to do/doing
- setting up a POISE laptop to use as a 'break glass' solution in case of live incidents
- fixing the issues found during Penetration and Operational Assurance Testing
- complete the Hardware Security Modules commissioning 
- completing all the operational preparation for going live at the end of March
- documenting the test strategy
- show and tell next wednesday
- recruiting an analyst (to look for benefits, savings opportunities for the CDP) and a tech 'ambassador' (someone who can share what we are doing across the HO and work with other teams to leverage solutions benefitting both CDP and their own products

### Things to be aware off
 - CDP and ABC due to go live by the end of March
