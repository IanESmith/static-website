## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 21 Feb 2018
Working with our Advanced Border Control and HMPO colleagues to provide a secure platform for their data and then start to onboard more tenants.

### What is blocking us
- found out that CSOC have no plan to onboard CDP until the end of 2018, which was a suprise. We are looking at a tactical solution for now and escalating the need for a stategic solution

### Just done
- installed the Hardware Security Modules (ie racked and cabled) into HODC1 and 2
- Penetration testing and fixes
- created a suite of reports to provide automatic programme and project status (ie live from jira) including all milestones, risks/issues and dependencies
- finalised the test strategy
- only just clarified the user needs for ABC

### About to do/doing
- get 'Authority to Operate' and Accredication
- completing all the operational preparation for going live at the end of March
- complete the Hardware Security Modules commissioning
- complete the OAT and fixes
- setting up a POISE laptop to use as a 'break glass' solution in case of live incidents
- documenting the test strategy
- show and tell next wednesday
- recruiting an analyst (to look for benefits, savings opportunities for the CDP) and a tech 'ambassador' (someone who can share what we are doing across the HO and work with other teams to leverage solutions benefitting both CDP and their own products
- complete the programme health check questionairre and invite folk to submit their responses
- publish and share the roadmap for 2018 showing our devliverables for ABC, HMPO and CDP
