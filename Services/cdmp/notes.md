## Common Data Matching Platform

### Summary as of 20 September  2017
Working with our Advanced Border Control colleagues to provide a platform for their data.
We are also starting to plan bringing our HMPO colleagues onto the Commmon Data Platform.

### What is blocking us
Our main challenge is remains around people. We still dont have a technical lead, the team is very small, and the challenges around folk on holiday, ill, affected by the Waterloo disruption or out of office reduce our effectiveness. Its possible we may lose the security team also. We're tracking progress and am able to see the team velocity (and its impact on due dates). 

### Just done
- agreed (with our HMPO collegaues) the high level roadmap to onboard HMPO
- completed the threat and impact assessment - all looking in good shape for the accreditation
- finalised the (light touch) live support model using ServiceNow
- added the team health data to the [metrics](metrics.html)
- delivered the development environments for our ABC colleagues

### About to do/doing
- completing all the security work required for the entire CDP platform (not just ABC)
- show and tell our work around security and accreditation
- create the CDP account on ServiceNow
- start connecting (and testing) ABC to the CDP
- finalise the detailed roadmap to onboard HMPO
