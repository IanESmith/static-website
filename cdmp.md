description: a weekly update on progress and blockers


### What is blocking us
Always best call out the bad news first, so....

The scope for the MVP is still not finalised, which means we cant start tracking and reporting progress. Howeever, the good news is that with a Product Manager in place, this should be resolved in the next days.

### Just done
* been assessed by the Service Standards team: no showstoppers but it did give us ideas on improving
* started joining up our planning with the Advanced Border Controls team
* agreed Alistair McKay as the Product Manager

### About to do
* finalise the scope
* start reporting on progress and estimated due date

### Things to be aware off
* we may need to grow the team (including user researchers, developers, security folk)
* we're going to start planning for after MVP and agreeing the next users
