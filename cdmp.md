description: a weekly update on progress and blockers


### What is blocking us
Always best call out the bad news first, so....

The scope for the MVP is still not finalised, which means i cant start tracking and reporting progress. Howeever, the good news is that with a Product Manager in place, this should be resolved in the next days.

#### Just done:
- been assessed by the Service Standards team (so we can highlight areas to improve)
- started joining up our planning with the Advanced Border Controls team
- agreed Alistair McKay as the Product Manager

#### About to do:
- finalise the scope
- start reporting on progress and estimated due date
