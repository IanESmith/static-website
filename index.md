# Home Office Delivery Performance

Where you can see how well we are able to deliver. Will be basic for the first weeks but then real data will start to be added.

## Common Data Matching Platform 
Status as at 25 July 2017

### What is blocking us
Always best call out the bad news first, so....

The scope for the MVP is still not finalised, which means i cant start tracking and reporting progress. Howeever, the good news is that with a Product Manager in place, this should be resolved in the next days.

#### Just done:
- been assessed by the Service Standards team (so we can highlight areas to improve)
- started joining up our planning with the Advanced Border Controls team
- agreed Alistair McKay as the Product Manager

#### About to do:

- finalise the scope
- start reporting on progress and estimated due date

## The background

The Common Data Matching Platform is planned to be a cross programme data platform used to support the functional programmes. It's primary purpose is to support the Home Office's strategic goal of hosting a "Person Centric" life-cycle for information. It needs to be able to cope with large volumes of transactions and the data that results; the ingestion of large and volatile volumes of bulk information both from legacy systems, carriers, hauliers, and other sources; the processing and analysis of data both in real time and in the background; and the storage and management of data securely and in compliance to user and departmental policy.

The last year has seen a proof of concept to explore the technical deisgn and implementation.

Now, the programme needs to move from a technical proving phase to a business and user proving phase.

We plan to deliver a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) over the coming months so as to deliver a working solution for some real users and also allow us to iterate and improve the product.

We’re also keen to bring along different businesses as we settle on options for isolating business data – the journey together will be key.
